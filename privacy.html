        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="privacy-meta">Last updated: 17 February 2026</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          RapidChoice is a lightweight decision-making app that helps you make random choices using
          wheels, dice and coin flips. This Privacy Policy explains what data we ("we", "us" or
          "our") collect, how we use it and what rights you have. We designed RapidChoice so that it
          works primarily on your device without creating an account or building a profile about
          you.
        </p>

        <h2>2. No gambling, no harmful content</h2>
        <p>
          RapidChoice is <strong>not</strong> a gambling application. The random results generated by
          the app (wheel outcomes, dice rolls, coin flips) have no monetary value, are not linked to
          real-money prizes and cannot be used to place bets or wagers within the app.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app is intended for general use (for example deciding what to eat, what to watch or
          which activity to try) and does not include violent, sexual or otherwise age-restricted
          content. RapidChoice does not encourage risky behaviour and is not designed to be harmful
          to children; however, parents and guardians should decide whether the app is appropriate
          for younger children.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Data we collect</h2>
        <p>
          RapidChoice does not require you to create an account and does not ask for information such
          as your name, email address, phone number or precise location.
        </p>
        <p>On your device, the app stores the following information so it can function correctly:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Decision content:</strong> your wheels, categories, options, dice roll history
            and related configuration.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>App settings:</strong> theme preference (light/dark/auto), language selection,
            haptic and sound toggles and similar preferences.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This data is stored locally on your device using Apple-provided technologies such as
          <em>UserDefaults</em>. We do not maintain our own backend database for this data.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Analytics and logging</h2>
        <p>
          RapidChoice does not integrate third-party analytics SDKs or advertising SDKs. We do not
          collect usage statistics that identify you personally. Apple and the operating system may
          collect basic diagnostic information about app crashes or performance as part of
          system-level analytics, depending on the settings you configured in iOS. Those diagnostics
          are controlled by Apple and are governed by Apple's privacy policies.
        </p>

        <h2>5. How we use your data</h2>
        <p>We use your data only for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>to save and restore your wheels, options and past rolls on your device;</li>
          <li>to remember your preferences such as language, theme and haptic settings;</li>
          <li>to keep the app running reliably and improve it over time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We do not use your decision content to profile you, to show targeted advertising or to
          sell data to third parties.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Data sharing and third parties</h2>
        <p>
          We do not sell, rent or trade your personal data. RapidChoice does not display
          third‑party ads and does not send your in-app content (such as wheel names or options) to
          external services.
        </p>
        <p>
          In limited circumstances, we may be required to disclose information if reasonably
          necessary to comply with a legal obligation, to respond to lawful requests from public
          authorities or to protect our rights, users or the public. Because RapidChoice stores
          almost all content only on your device, in most cases we do not have access to your
          individual decision data.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Children</h2>
        <p>
          RapidChoice is suitable for a broad audience and can be used by families together. The app
          does not contain gambling features, in-app purchases for real money or content that is
          intentionally harmful to children.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Device permissions and sensors</h2>
        <p>
          RapidChoice may use certain device capabilities provided by Apple solely to implement app
          features, for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Haptics:</strong> to provide vibration feedback when you spin a wheel, roll the
            dice or flip the coin.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Motion sensors (shake detection):</strong> to allow you to roll the dice by
            shaking your device.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We do not access your contacts, photos, microphone, camera, precise location or other
          sensitive device data.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Data retention</h2>
        <p>
          Your decision content and settings are stored on your device until you delete the app or
          reset its data (for example, by reinstalling). Because we do not store this information on
          our own servers, deleting the app will usually delete the associated data.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Your rights</h2>
        <p>
          Because RapidChoice does not maintain user accounts or a central database of your
          decisions, most of the control over your data is in your hands. You can:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>edit or delete wheels, options and other content inside the app; and</li>
          <li>remove the app from your device to delete locally stored data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>11. International transfers</h2>
        <p>
          At this time, RapidChoice does not transfer your in-app decision content to our own
          servers. Any information potentially processed by Apple (for example through the App Store
          or iCloud backups) is handled under Apple's infrastructure and policies.
        </p>

        <h2>12. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app, legal
          requirements or best practices. When we make material changes, we will update the "Last
          updated" date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this Policy regularly.
        </p>

        <h2>13. Contact</h2>
